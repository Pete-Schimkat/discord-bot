# discord-bot
A private project developed with the powerful API discord.py in python. Originally used on private servers. Note that I developed this years ago and have stopped maintaining it. Discord.py and other API's used in this code have since been extensively reworked and are likely to not function properly anymore.

## Features
* Basic commands that send arbitrary text or images 
* Soundboard commands that let the bot join a voice channel to play a specific sound and then leave again
* Weather commands check the current weather or the forecast 
* Music commands: Let the bot search for a given query and play the respective song in voice chat
* Reddit commands: Browse pre-defined or custom sub-reddits and send posts from that sub to text-channels
